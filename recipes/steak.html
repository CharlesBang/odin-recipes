        <img src="../images/steak.jpg">

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
                <li>2 lbs New York Strip Steaks (2 steaks), or Ribeye or Top Sirloin Steaks (1 lb each steak, 1 1/4‚Äù thick)</li>
                <li>1/2 Tbsp vegetable oil, or any high heat cooking oil like canola or extra light olive oil</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
                <li>1 tsp black pepper, freshly ground</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and quartered</li>
                <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Thoroughly pat steak dry with paper towels. Just before cooking, generously season with 1 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp black pepper</li>
            </ol>

        <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the cast iron pan until hot then add 1/2 Tbsp oil over medium-high heat, swirling to coat.</li>
                <li>Once the oil is very hot, add steaks to the skillet. Sear the steaks on the first side for 4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then flip and cook another 3-4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Using tongs, turn the steak on its sides to render the white fat and sear the edges (1-minute per edge).</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium and immediately add 2 Tbsp butter, quartered garlic cloves and rosemary to the pan.</li>
                <li>Spoon the butter sauce over the steak, tilting the pan to get butter on your spoon.</li>
                <li>Continue spooning the sauce over the steak for a minute or until the steak is about 5-10 degrees from your desired doneness (the temperature will continue to rise another 5-10 degrees while steaks rest).</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Transfer steak to a cutting board, loosely cover and rest 10 minutes before slicing into 1/2" strips to serve.</li>
                <li>Spoon extra butter sauce over sliced steak to serve.</li>
            </ol>
